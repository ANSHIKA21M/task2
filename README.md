The Entrypoint class is the main class of the application.
The @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to indicate that this is a Spring Boot application and enables various auto-configuration features.
The DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class is excluded from auto-configuration using the exclude attribute. This is done to disable the default DataSource configuration since it may not be needed in this specific application.
The main method is the entry point of the application, and it calls SpringApplication.run to start the Spring Boot application.






The data model provided for the Spring application consists of several entities such as Advisor, Client, Portfolio, Security, and Transaction. Each entity has its own set of attributes and relationships with other entities. For example, an Advisor can have multiple Clients, a Client can have multiple Portfolios, a Portfolio can have multiple Securities, and a Security can belong to multiple Portfolios. The Transaction entity has relationships with both the Security and Portfolio entities. This data model is used to represent the relationships between financial advisors, clients, portfolios, securities, and transactions in the system.
